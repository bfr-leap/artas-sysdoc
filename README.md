## Overview

**`artas-sysdoc`** is a repository dedicated to storing and managing visual assets related to system documentation within the LEAP ecosystem. These assets include icons, diagrams, and other graphical elements used to enhance documentation and improve understanding of system components and workflows.

This repository is an integral part of the LEAP platform, supporting the creation of clear, visually engaging documentation for both developers and end-users.

## Repository Structure

The repository is organized into the following directories:

- **`icons/`**
  - Contains small graphical elements, such as subsystem icons, for use in documentation and web front ends.

- **`diagrams/`**
  - Includes system diagrams and architectural schematics.

- **`backgrounds/`**
  - Stores background images and other visual assets used in documentation or multimedia presentations.

- **`logos/`**
  - Houses league and racetrack logos for consistent branding across documentation and front-end components.

- **`wallpapers/`**
  - Provides high-resolution wallpapers for promotional materials and presentation backdrops.

## Purpose

The **`artas-sysdoc`** repository serves the following goals:

1. **Centralized Asset Management:** Provide a single location for storing and accessing visual documentation assets.
2. **Consistency:** Ensure a uniform visual style across all LEAP documentation and interfaces.

2. **File Format:**
   - Use vector formats (e.g., SVG) for icons and diagrams whenever possible.
   - Use high-resolution PNG or JPEG formats for backgrounds and wallpapers.

3. **Directory Placement:**
   - Place assets in the appropriate directory based on their type (e.g., icons in `icons/`, diagrams in `diagrams/`).

4. **Commit Messages:**
   - Use clear and descriptive commit messages (e.g., "Add subsystem icon for telemetry module").

5. **Pull Requests:**
   - Submit a pull request with a detailed description of the changes.
